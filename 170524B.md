The project allowed us to set up/run, and test a blockchain ledger. 
While doing the project had the chance to read about permissionless and permissioned distributed ledger platforms.
Could gain a basic understanding of smart contracts ( or chaincode). Chaincode operates as a trusted distributed application that acquires its security from the blockchain and the underlying consensus among the peers.
Also learned about the proposed execute-order-validate approach where the new validate step checks transactions against an application-specific endorsement policy before committing them to the ledger
